Thanks for Using UniPolyWater! 

Included in this package:

    Shaders: 
        1. UniPolyWater - Clean no transparency shader - low poly flat shaded gerstner waves. (Works with Screen Space Reflections)
        2. UniPolyWater with Collisions - as above with possibility to have waves from collisions etc. 
        3. UniPolyWater with transparency and shore - self explainatory. (Does not work with SSR) 
        4. UniPolyWater with transparency, shore and collisions.

    Editor Script:
        UniPolyWaterPlane Creation Tool - Found under GameObject > Create Other > UniPolyWater Plane.. 
            Set number of Width and Length segments and create a plane for use with the UniPolyWater shader.

    Model: 
        100x100 Segment UniPolyWaterPlane - for use with the shader.

    Scenes:
        Test scene showing of the features of the shaders.

    Scripts:
        Scripts used in the Test scene.
         
    Material: 
        Materials used in the Test scene.

The shaders will only work with planes made with the included tool.

See the included test scene for an example of how to use the collision-feature of the shaders.

Feel free to use the included tools/shaders for any project, commercial or non-commercial.
